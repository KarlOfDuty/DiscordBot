### The following is the config settings I personally use as an example on how to set it up.

# Your bot token
token: ""

# Prefix for discord commands
prefix: "+"

# Sends more console messages
verbose: false

# Sets which channels users can use commands in and which users have permission to use the commands.
# Permissions can be given to Discord roles and individual Discord users. All of the config arrays use IDs, not names.
# Set to "*" to allow everything.
commands:
